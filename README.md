# GIAB Truvari SV Benchmarking Pipeline

Snakemake pipeline for SV benchmarking.
Pipeline runs truvari bench followed by truvari refine then generates a table with combined benchmarking results and a README file summarizing and documenting the analysis.
The pipeline is a work in process and does not represent best practices.
The documentation is incomplete and intended for internal NIST-GIAB team use.
Feel free to submit an issue or email Nate Olson (nolson@nist.gov) if you have questions about using the GIAB SV benchmarks.
